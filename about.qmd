## Howdy -- my name is Frank Hull

Welcome to my personal website & blog, where I discuss topics & projects related to the intersection of my professional career & hobbies.

### Professional Background

#### Energy & Data

With 10+ years of experience in the energy and power markets, I have developed a strong background in data analytics, energy portfolio management, and risk assessment. My expertise includes statistical and machine learning methods, stochastic simulations, portfolio optimization & quantifying uncertainty. I have experience with over 50+ energy companies, across various ISOs and non-ISOs regions, in the USA and internationally as well.

### Hobbies and Interests

Outside of my professional life, I have a deep passion for open-source programming, music, and the outdoors. 

#### Open-Source Projects

I have developed various open-source projects, mostly related to bindings and interoperability. I also like to mess around with shaders and fluid dynamics. I enjoy programming & open-source projects are a fun way to challenge myself. 

-   **ml/dl bindings**
    -   {maize} - tidymodels extension for support vector machines and kernels in R
    -   {kantime} - nixtla wrapper for Time Series Kolmogorov Arnold Networks in R
-   **color palettes**
    -   {BobRossColors} - color schemes based on 403 Bob Ross Paintings in R
    -   {AlbumCoverColors.jl} - color schemes for albums in Julia
-   **shaders**
    -   {waveshaders} - tutorials on simulating fluids and displaying with {rayshader}
-   **prompts/ai**
    -   {ggpal2} - an AI assistant that helps create ggplot2 visualizations
    -   {meznet} - discussion on CompVis vs LLMs for Image Recognition

#### Music

I have been playing the guitar since a teenager. I have always loved playing music with other musicians and friends. I also blame tablature for my love of numbers and patterns, not math. I also play keys, bouzouki, ukulele, mandolin, ~anything with frets. My most successful band was when I was in college, *Wake*, where we explored sounds in a genre somewhat related to post, progressive, and experimental rock. In the last few years I've been teaching myself how to play drums and really enjoying the challenge. 


#### Outdoors

I am an avid outdoor enthusiast and enjoy activities such as hiking, camping, backpacking, foraging, and climbing. These hobbies help me maintain a balanced life, earthbound, and connect with human nature. Whether it's planning a day-hike or leading an expedition, outside is where I thrive.


### Why This Blog?

This blog is a platform for me to share my thoughts & experiences that may not fit in a X/bluesky post. Where the discussions are niche and overlap between professional experience and hobby interests. This is dual purpose as I like to test quarto as a documentation and reporting interface. You won't be reading about my opinions on energy, nor how to build a weather-driven stochastic framework for the lower US-48. You may see discussions around my open source projects, music-math overlaps, fretboard interference, & visualizing natural terrains -- or who knows. The blogs are empty, at the moment I'm just trying to build a website and test _brand.yml with quarto v1.6
